I am a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles studying computer science. Earlier this year, I completed my bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I am interested in computer graphics and its subdiscipline in rendering. I studied the basics of the subject in the [computer graphics class][CS559-Outline] at UWM. I further explored the past, now, and future of the discipline with Lingqi Yan's open courseware: [Games 101][Game101-Class] and [Games 202][Game202-Class] delivered in Mandarin. The course outline of the class in English are located at [CS180][CS180-Class] and [CS291A][CS291A-Class]. 

Furthermore, internship experience at NetEase, China working on building and optimizing the rendering algorithm in the game engine provided me the insights into how rendering engineers work in collaboration with the artists, designers, and non-rendering programming in shipping game products. The experience also trained me in using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming to write the engine's source code, GLSL and DirectX to implement the rendering algorithms, and Nvidia Nsight to profile the performance.

I am now learning Cuda Programming using the public resources available at [UPenn][https://cis565-fall-2021.github.io/]. I will also work on the [course's projects][CIS565-Projects]. I am also studying wireless network protocol at UCLA under the supervising of Professor [Songwu Lu][Songwu-Lu] and will complete a PhD-mentored project in the area.

I have always been interested in learning more on the current applications and researches done in the area of computer graphics and how games are designed and produced. Therefore I will try to share my thoughts and studies in SIGGRAPH Courses and GDC sharings. 

I always enjoy playing games and watching movies, dramas, and animations in all languages! 

This website is built to share my learning notes, projects, and other interesting things.
